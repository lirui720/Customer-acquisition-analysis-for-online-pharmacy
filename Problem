Problem
In order to improve conversion rates, the product team needs to understand any potential dropoff
points in the acquisition funnel, from user registration to assessment completion. Your goal is
to identify these drop-off points and provide a reason as to why you believe this type of question
could result in user drop-off, as well as any suggestions you may have to fix it. How you choose
to analyze this data is completely up to you. Feel free to use whatever tool you would like
(Excel, SQL, Python, R, Tableau, etc.) and please show your work
